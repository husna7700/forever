                Hey my love, <br>

                From the moment you became a part of my world, everything transformed.  
                You are the melody in my silence, the warmth in my soul,  
                and the light that turns my darkest nights into golden dawns.  
                Every heartbeat of mine whispers your name,  
                and with every breath, I choose you again and again.  

                You are my love, my safe place, my forever.  
                I promise to cherish, love, and stand by you—  
                not just for today, not just for tomorrow,  
                but for every moment, in every lifetime.<br>

                <strong>With all that I am and all that I will ever be,</strong>  
                Yours,<br> forever…  
            </p>
